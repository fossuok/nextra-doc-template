# Introduction to Website Design

Welcome to the contributor's guide for FOSS UoK website! We follow the **Primer Design** system, which is GitHub’s design system. Primer provides a consistent and accessible user experience across different platforms. If you’re a beginner looking to contribute, this document will help you understand the key principles and guidelines to follow.

We also use [**Mantine UI**](https://mantine.dev/) for our components and ensure they are aligned with Primer Design principles.

## Guidelines for Contributors

### 1. Follow the Primer Styling
- Instead of using default Primer components, we used **Mantine UI components** to develop website.
- Ensure that **Mantine UI components** are styled and customized to align with Primer Design.
- Follow the typography and spacing conventions defined in Primer.

### 2. Maintain Consistency
- Stick to the defined color palette and UI elements.
- Ensure buttons, inputs, and navigation bars match the existing style.
- When using **Mantine UI components**, apply Primer-compatible styles and configurations.

### 3. Accessibility Matters
- Always ensure proper **contrast, focus states, and keyboard navigability**.
- Use **ARIA attributes** where necessary to improve usability.

### 4. Responsive Design
- Ensure the website looks good on different screen sizes.
- Use flexible grid layouts and avoid fixed widths.

### 5. Code Standards
- Keep code **clean and well-documented**.
- Follow **semantic HTML** principles and use **BEM naming convention** for CSS.

### 6. Testing & Review
- Before submitting a pull request, test your changes in both **light and dark modes**.
- Ensure no breaking changes in existing components.
- Verify that **Mantine UI components** function correctly and maintain the Primer Design look and feel.
