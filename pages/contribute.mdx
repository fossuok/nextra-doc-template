# Contributing via GitHub

Welcome to **FOSS Community, University of Kelaniya (FOSSUOK)**! We maintain several repositories, including the **FOSS_Official_Website**. This guide will help new contributors get started with contributing to our repositories directly via GitHub.

## **1. Cloning the Repository**

To contribute, first, clone the repository to your local machine.

### **Steps to Clone:**
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/FOSSUOK/FOSS_Official_Website.git
   ```

4. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd FOSS_Official_Website
   ```

If you are outside the organization, you may need to fork the repository before cloning.

## **2. Setting Up the Project**

After cloning the repository, set up the project environment:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed.
2. Install project dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

This will launch the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

## **3. Creating a New Branch**

Before making changes, create a new branch:

```sh
git branch your-feature-branch
```

```sh
git checkout your-feature-branch
```
Replace `your-feature-branch` with a meaningful name for your changes.

## **4. Making Changes & Committing**

1. Make your modifications in the codebase.
2. Stage your changes:

   ```sh
   git add .
   ```

3. Commit your changes with a meaningful message:

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

---

## **5. Pushing Changes & Creating a Pull Request**

1. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```sh
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

2. Go to the repository on GitHub.
3. Click on **Pull Requests** > **New Pull Request**.
4. Select your branch and submit the pull request for review.

## **6. Staying Updated with the Main Repository**

To keep your local repository up to date with the latest changes:

```sh
git pull origin main
```

This ensures you are working with the latest version of the project.
