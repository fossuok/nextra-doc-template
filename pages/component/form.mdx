# Forms

Forms allow users to input data that is sent to a server for processing.

## Usage

Forms can be used for a variety of purposes, including survey, collecting information, and feedback. 

## Code Example

```jsx copy
<FormControl required>
  <FormControl.Label>
    Form Input Label
  </FormControl.Label>
  <Checkbox />
</FormControl>
```

## Accessibility

- Use `aria-describedby` to associate inputs with error or helper messages.

```jsx copy
<span id="email-error">Invalid email address</span>
<input aria-describedby="email-error" />
```
- Add form controls according to the situation
